# Next color viewer

I made this "color viewer" with `nextJS`. Here you can see your favorite colors' name, and get some random ones if you want!

## How it works

At your first view, you'll see just a button ( i'll add more as time goes by ).

Then, when you click it, you'll go to `/colorname`, there you can see the name of any color you want, just like this:

You already have the `#`, so just write your HEX value! Else, you can see some errors in your page!

## Installation

- First, you need to clone this respository in your favorite terminal with

```console
git clone https://github.com/gasampaiosouza/next-color-viewer.git
```

- Then, inside the `/next-color-viewer` folder you need to install the packages. So still in your console, write `npm install` or `yarn add`

- After that, just run

```console
npm run dev
```

> It's going to run the server on port 3000

- That's it! to see the project just go to `http://localhost:3000/`, and you're ready to rock!
